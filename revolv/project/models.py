    PROPOSED. A proposed project is viewable by admins in their dashboard, as
    well as by the ambassadors that created it.

    When an admin approves a project, it becomes STAGED, which means it is ready
    to go but is not active yet, and as such is not viewable by the public. Staged
    projects are also visible to all admins in their dashboards. When it's time
    for the project to go live and start accepting donations, the admin can mark
    it as ACTIVE, which means it will actually be public and people can donate to
